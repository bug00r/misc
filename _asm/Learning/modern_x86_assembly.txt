		Description:
		
		AF	-	The auxiliary carry flag denotes a carry or borrow condition during binary-coded decimal addition or subtraction
		CF	-	The carry flag is et by the processor to signify an overflow condition when performing unsigned integer arithmetic. 
				It is also used by some register rotate and shift instructions.
		OF	-	The overflow flag signals that the result of a signed integer operation is too small or too large.
		PF	-	The parity flag indicates whether the least-significant byte of a result contains an even number of 1 bits
		ZF	-	was set by logical and arithmetic instructions with the result of zero
		SF	-	was set by logical and arithmetic instructions with the result of negative or positive
		DF	-	An	application program can set or reset the direction flag, which defines the auto increment direction 
				(0 = low-to-high addresses, 1 = high-to-low addresses) of the EDI and ESI registers during execution of the string 
				instructions
				
		The remaining bits in the EFLAGS register are used exclusively by the operating system to manage interrupts, restrict I/O
		operations, and support program debugging. They should never be modified by an application program. Reserved bits should 
		also never be modified and no assumptions should ever be made regarding the state of any reserved bit.

	Control and Status
	------------------
	MXCSR

- Many instructions require or implicitily specific registers as operands

	Example:	- imul(Signed Multiply) uses EDX to hold high order double word of product
				- idiv(Signed Divide)	uses EDX to hold high order double word of divident
				- String instructions   uses ESI(source address) and EDI(destination address)
										uses ECX as Count register by using repeat prefix
				- Bit shift and rotate instructions must load bit count value into CL register.
				- Proessor used ESP to support stack related operations such as functions calls and returns
				- EBP is typically used as base pointer to access data items that are stored on the stack.
				  When not employed as a byse pointer, it can be used as general purpose register.
					
				
- Stack is simply a continuous block of memory that is assigend to a process or thread by OS.
  Application Programs can also use the stack to pass function arguments and store temporara data.
  The ESP Register always point to the top of the stack(last stack item)
  
  You can use the ESP as a general purpose register but such use is impractical and strongly discouraged

- Instruction Operands

	- There are three types of operands
		- immediate (only source operands can be mmediate)
		- register (general purpose register)
		- memory (specific location in memory which can be any data type you can see above)
			- only source or destination operand can be memory operand, not both
	
	Operands Examples(intel syntax):
	
	Type			Example					Equivalent C/C++ Statement
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	Immediate		mov eax, 42				eax = 42
					imul ebx, 11h			ebx *= 0x11
					xor dl, 55h				dl ^= 0x55
					add esi, 8				esi += 8
	
	Register		mov eax, ebx			eax = ebx
					inc	ecx					ecx += 1
					add ebx, esi			ebx += esi
					mul ebx					edx:eax = eax * ebx		;implicit EAX and explicit EBX; Implicit register pair EDX:EAX used as destination.
																	;The multiplicative product’s high-order and low-order doublewords are stored
																	;in EDX and EAX, respectively
	
	Memory			mov eax, [ebx]			eax = *ebx
					add eax, [val1]			eax += *val1
					or ecx, [ebx+esi]		ecx |= *(ebx + esi)
					sub word ptr [edi], 12	*(short*)edi -= 12		;word ptr is like cast
					

	Memory Addressing Modes:
	
	The x86-32 instruction set supports using up to four separate components to specify a
	memory operand. The four components include a fixed displacement value, a base register,
	an index register, and a scale factor. Subsequent to each instruction fetch that specifies a
	memory operand, the processor calculates an effective address in order to determine the
	final memory address of the operand. An effective address is calculated as follows:
	
	Effective Address = BaseReg + IndexReg * ScaleFactor + Disp
	
	BaseReg				- can be any general purpose register 
	IndexReg			- can be any general purpose register except ESP
	Disp(Displacement)	- Constant Offsets that  are encoded within instruction
	ScaleFactor			- valid values are 1, 2, 4, 8
	EffectiveAddress	- The size of the effective Address is always 32 bits

	The x86-32 instruction set supports eight different memory-operand addressing forms, as listed in Table
	
	Addressing Form								Example
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	Disp										mov eax, [MyVal]
	BaseReg										mov eax, [ebx]
	BaseReg + Disp								mov eax, [ebx+12]
	Disp + IndexReg * ScaleFactor				mov eax, [MyArray+esi*4]
	BaseReg + IndexReg							mov eax, [ebx+esi]
	BaseReg + IndexReg + Disp					mov eax, [ebx+esi+12]
	BaseReg + IndexReg * ScaleFactor			mov eax, [ebx+esi*4] 
	BaseReg + IndexReg * ScaleFactor + Disp		mov eax, [ebx+esi*4+20]
